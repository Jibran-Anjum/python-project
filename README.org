* Why I Chose this Project
The main reason behind me choosing to do this project, is because I like playing games.So, I wanted to see if I'm
creativity enough to come up with a game of my own.

* About the Game
This game is simple. Here when you start the game by executing the main.py file, you'll have to enter your name
as a player. Then you'll have to move to one of four locations. In three of four locations you'll have to collect the
items in order to be fully equipped to fight the monster, that'll be on one of the four locations. If you've collected
all of the items you'll simply defeat the monster, otherwise you'll lose.
